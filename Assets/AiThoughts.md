AI does not want to actually win the game, the purpose of AI is to behave like it is doing something intelligent, while mostly
just giving the player different combat scenarios to experiment on. AI must not rush, sweat its ass off to win the game. AI should
be kinda chill and mostly act reactively.

Desire to capture building depends on:
	- How early it is in the game, the earlier the more AI wants to "explore" the map and capture new buildings;
	- How much buildings the enemy has, AI wants to keep the parity of the income. For the HARD AI it wants to capture all the buildings regardlss of the parity...
	- AI wants to capture the enemy HQ the most, factories and airport second and cities the last;
	- The location of a building: the building located in a strategically important point or route is more desirable;

Desire to kill an enemy unit depends on:
	- How far it is. For artillery units the enemy units in the range of fire are considered to be at zero distance;
	- If it is possible to kill an enemy in one move;
	- If the attacker unit is an artillery unit and it is in a safe position;
	- How close the enemy unit is to the HQ;
	- The parity of forces in the area: the more parity it is the more it makes sense to attack;
	- The enemy unit position: an enemy behind the frontline is more important to get rid of than an enemy unit on the frontline itself;
	- The more valuable the enemy unit is AND the more damage it can suffer. This includes APC carrying valuable units;
	- Preventive attack - the unit is going to be attacked anyway, then attack first;

Desire to move to a different location depends on:
	- To improve the parity of forces in a certain area;
	- To move into a strategically important place;
	- How much protection the new location provides. For example in makes way more sense for an infantry unit to move to a mountain
	  simply because it provides more protection even without any threat present.
	- How much of an attack area the new location provides for an indirect unit. In makes sense to move a unit to a position it has more attack positions to control in a contested area.
	- For the artilery units in makes sense to move to a contested area with a few friendly direct attack units. Without having direct attack units it does not makes sense to move there since the artillery unit is most likely going to be destroyed by enemy forces.
